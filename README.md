- 👋 Hi, I’m @hacknback
- 👀 I’m interested in creating stuff for hacking/pentesting. I run a website hacknback.com.  I sell software, hardware and scripts.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on the largest wordlist of usernames and passwords currently at 541mb called letmein.txt.
- 💞️ I love making things to help people learn and advance their pentesting skills.
